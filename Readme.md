# JEMACS

My personal minimalistic emacs configuration.
After having used spacemacs for some time, I figured I should create my own configuration.

This configuration is still similar to spacemacs but only installs the packages I usually use and nothing more.

Many thanks to [systemcrafters](https://systemcrafters.net)! 
He creates awesome videos and has a nice guides to help getting started with basic and advanced configurations.
